🏔️ ## Highest Mountains Project (Web Scraping & Data Analysis with Python)
🚀 Project Overview

This project explores the highest mountains in the world using data collected from Wikipedia’s “List of mountains by elevation” page.
The data was extracted directly from the web using Python’s web scraping capabilities (requests + pandas.read_html) and combined into one complete dataset for analysis.

The goal of this project was to:

Scrape and merge multiple mountain elevation tables from Wikipedia

Analyze the dataset to find how many mountains belong to different countries

Calculate the percentage of mountains located in the United States, India, and Canada

Visualize mountain height comparisons using a bar chart

🧩 Problem Statement

Mountains across the world are distributed across various ranges and elevations.
However, this data is often scattered across multiple tables online.

The challenge was to collect, clean, and combine this scattered information from Wikipedia to create a single, structured dataset for global mountain analysis.

❓ Key Analytical Questions

How can we extract structured mountain data from a Wikipedia page using Python?

What is the total number of mountains listed across all elevation ranges?

What percentage of mountains are located in the United States, India, and Canada?

How do the heights of selected mountains compare visually?

🔍 Data Extraction Process

The dataset was gathered using the following steps:

Fetched data from Wikipedia:Used the URL List of mountains by elevation.
The requests library was used to retrieve HTML content.

Parsed HTML tables using Pandas:
pd.read_html() automatically detected and extracted all mountain tables (8 total tables ranging from 8,000m to 1,000m+).

Merged all tables:
Each table was combined into a single DataFrame of 1,651 rows, containing columns like
Mountain, Metres, Feet, Range, and Location and notes.

Exported the final dataset:
Saved the merged dataset as combined_dataset.csv for future analysis.

📊 Analysis & Findings
🌎 Total Mountains Combined

1,651 mountains merged into a single dataset.

Mountains in the United States:

348 mountains found in the U.S.

Percentage: 21.09% of total dataset.

Mountains in India:

95 mountains found in India.

Percentage: 5.75% of total dataset.

Mountains in Canada:

96 mountains found in Canada.

Percentage: 5.82% of total dataset.

📈 Visualization Insights

A bar chart was created to visualize the height differences among selected mountains.

Since the dataset contains over 1,000 entries, every 61st mountain was selected for visualization.
This helped compare the elevations without overcrowding the chart.

📊 Chart: Heights of Various Mountains (Sampled Every 61st)
The chart shows how Mount Everest dominates the dataset, standing at 8,848 meters, followed by other 8,000m+ peaks in the Himalayas and Karakoram ranges.
